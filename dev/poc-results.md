# PoC results: server side (section A of poc-checklist.md)

Date: 2026-09-30. Pack 0.1.0 on branch `dev`, Minecraft 1.21.1, NeoForge 21.1.252, Temurin 21.0.12.1, `-Xms6G -Xmx8G`.
Server: `test-server/`, synced from `http://localhost:8080/pack.toml`, fresh world (`--wipe-world`, seed random,
spawn -2912 / -2236). No player joined. Everything that needs a player is marked **needs client**.

## Tools used (all in `dev/`, no downloads)

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `run_server.py --hold N` | keeps the server running for RCON; lines appended to `test-server/logs/run_server-input.txt` go to the console (spark answers asynchronously, so RCON never sees its output) |
| `rcon.py "cmd" ...` | minimal RCON client; reads port and password from `test-server/server.properties` |
| `/fa_dump`, `/fa_recipe <regex>`, `/fa_dims` | console commands in `kubejs/server_scripts/debug/dump.js`: recipe and tag dump with the ProgressiveStages lock of each recipe, recipe inspector, dimension locks and ore-override count |
| `/fa_selftest` | console command in `kubejs/server_scripts/stages/grants.js`: a FakePlayer walks dawn to age_6 and back, `reconcile()` runs after each step |
| `poc_analyze.py` | reads the `/fa_dump` files and prints PASS/FAIL per recipe or tag check |
| `scan_regions.py` | offline Anvil reader: block counts per id in the generated chunks (run `save-all flush` first) |

## Results

| # | Check | Command | Expected | Observed | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Generator up to date | `python dev/gen_stage_locks.py --check` | `checked 0 file(s)`, exit 0 | `checked 0 file(s)`, exit 0 | pass |
| A2 | JS syntax | `node --check` on the 15 files under `kubejs/` | no error | no error | pass |
| A3 | Stage files load | `progressivestages validate`; console grep | `28/28 stage files valid`, no `Failed to parse stage file`, no `Invalid ore override entry` | `SUMMARY: 28/28 stage files valid, all passed!`; 0 matching log lines | pass |
| A4 | Stage tree | `stage tree` | `dawn → age_0 → … → age_9 → finale_won`, `ftbchunks_mapping` under `age_2` | exactly that; mob_0..9, tool_*, disabled are roots | pass |
| A5 | KubeJS without errors | `logs/kubejs/startup.log`, `server.log` | 0 errors | 2/2 startup, 12/12 server scripts, 0 errors, 0 warnings. **Two latent Rhino bugs fixed first** (see Fixes 1) | pass after fix |
| A6 | Recipe balance | `reload`, `logs/kubejs/server.log` | Added/Removed line, no `Unable to parse recipe filter` | `Added 261 recipes, removed 217 recipes, modified 17 recipes, with 0 failed recipes`; 0 filter warnings | pass |
| A7 | Pack recipes present | `/fa_dump` + `poc_analyze.py` | hearthstone, sky_disc, steel_heart, pressing/tfc_sheet_bronze, crushing/rich_hematite | all present; plus `firmages:knapping/unfired_hearth_idol` (tfc:knapping) and 9 `firmages:heating/*` (tfc:heating) | pass |
| A8 | Removed recipes absent | same | no create:pressing/iron_ingot, mixing/brass_ingot, crafting/materials/andesite_alloy, crushing/raw_iron, ftbquests:book recipe | none present | pass |
| A9 | Tags | `/fa_dump` item_tags.json | `c:plates/iron` has `tfc:metal/sheet/wrought_iron`, not `create:iron_sheet`; `c:hidden_from_recipe_viewers` = HIDDEN_ITEMS | `c:plates/iron` = IE plate, Ad Astra plate, TFC sheet (Almost Unified makes the TFC sheet the target and hides the other two); hidden tag holds all 33 | pass |
| A10 | FTB provider | `progressivestages ftb status` | Provider Registered YES | Registered YES, Compat Active YES, Previous Provider Stored YES (XMod's KubeJS Stages provider) | pass |
| A11 | World configs | fresh world; `config/tfc-server.toml`, `config/immersiveengineering-server.toml`, `config/Mekanism/world.toml` | surface monsters on, `vein_size = 0`, ore generation off | `enableVanillaMonstersOnSurface = true`; 6 × `vein_size = 0`; the 6 ore-level `shouldGenerate = false` (vein-level keys stay `true`, which is harmless because the ore level is off; worldgen scan shows 0 Mekanism blocks). The files land in `config/`, not `world/serverconfig/` (see boot-report) | pass |
| A12 | FTB Chunks defaults | `logs/debug.log`, `config/ftbchunks-world.snbt` | no SNBT errors; protection off, PvP on, map needs stage, 0 claims | `tracking config ftbchunks-world, loaded from ...\config\ftbchunks-world.snbt`; `disable_protection: true`, `pvp_mode: "always"`, `require_game_stage: true`, `max_claimed_chunks: 0`, `max_force_loaded_chunks: 0`, `force_load_mode: "never"`, `party_limit_mode: "largest"` | pass |
| A13 | KubeJS datapack active | `datapack list` | KubeJS data active | `datapack list` shows 8 packs and no separate KubeJS entry (KubeJS 2101 injects its data differently). Proven by effect: the `neoforge:none` biome-modifier overrides work (worldgen rows below) and the `firmages` recipes load | pass (by effect) |
| A14 | Idle baseline | `spark tps`, `spark health`, `spark profiler` 5 min idle | baseline for C3 | see Performance below | done |

### Stages and the reconcile logic

`stage grant/revoke/list` need an online player (`stage grant FA_Nobody age_0` → `No player was found`), and
ProgressiveStages fires `onGranted`/`onRevoked` only for players in the server list. The script logic was therefore driven
with a FakePlayer (`/fa_selftest`), calling `reconcile()` after each grant or revoke.

| Step | Stages after the step | Expected (grants.js + 00_constants.js) | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| grant dawn | dawn, mob_0 | mob_0 | pass |
| grant age_0 | + age_0 | mob_0 only | pass |
| grant age_1 | + age_1, mob_1 | cumulative ladder | pass |
| grant age_2 | + age_2, mob_2, ftbchunks_mapping, tool_toms_storage | map stage and Tom's window open | pass |
| grant age_3 | + age_3, mob_3 | | pass |
| grant age_4 | + age_4, mob_4, tool_ie_alloy_kiln, tool_ie_capacitor, tool_mech_spawner | IE and spawner windows open | pass |
| grant age_5 | + age_5, mob_5; tool_ie_alloy_kiln gone | kiln window [age_4, age_5) | pass |
| grant age_6 | + age_6, mob_6; tool_toms_storage, tool_ie_capacitor, tool_mech_spawner gone | windows close with age_6 | pass |
| revoke age_6 … age_2 | each step restores the previous state exactly; after revoking age_2: age_0, age_1, dawn, mob_0, mob_1 | idempotent reconcile | pass |
| cleanup | [] | | pass |

| Check | Command | Observed | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grant/revoke for a real team via console | `stage grant <player> age_1` | needs an online player | needs client (C1, C8, C20, C21) |
| Event wiring (quest reward → onGranted → reconcile, age title) | – | PS fires script hooks only for listed players | needs client (C20, C21) |
| Chunk quota at age_4 | `ftbchunks admin extra_claim_chunks FA_Nobody set 25` | the command parses and fails only on the player lookup (`No player was found`); same for `extra_force_load_chunks` | syntax pass; needs client (C17) |

### Recipe gating and unification (`poc_analyze.py`, final dump: 35,542 recipes, 3,426 item tags)

| Check | Expected | Observed | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dawn: vanilla grid recipes | every `minecraft:` crafting recipe locked in Dawn | 0 open | pass |
| Dawn: TFC grid whitelist | only stone-tool shafting, firestarter, straw/thatch, sticks, rope, obsidian tools | 44 TFC recipes open, all in the whitelist | pass |
| Dawn: other mods' grid recipes | – | 4,144 grid recipes of other mods carry no recipe, output or item lock (afc 796, dndecor 529, firmalife 378, createframed 323, createdeco 274, framedblocks 256, createcasing 241, mysticalagriculture 210, mekmm 183, beneath 118 …). Most need locked ingredients; not proven here | open point (needs Felix) |
| Create plates removed | no recipe makes create:{iron,copper,golden,brass}_sheet | none | pass |
| Create zinc/brass chain | no usable Create zinc/brass ingot source; TFC zinc → `9x create:zinc_nugget` → andesite alloy from `tfc:rock/cobble/andesite` | `firmages:crafting/zinc_nugget`, `firmages:heating/create_zinc_nugget`, `andesite_alloy_from_zinc` (grid and mixing) take `#c:nuggets/zinc` + TFC andesite cobble; iron variants gone. Before the fix TFC casting gave `create:zinc_ingot` (Almost Unified) and WoodenCog knapped andesite alloy from rocks alone (Fixes 2, 3). `occultism:miner/eldritch/raw_zinc` still gives `create:raw_zinc_block`, which the `disabled` stage locks | pass after fix |
| IE hammer plates / hammer crushing | no `crafting/plate_*_hammering`, `hammercrushing_*`, `raw_hammercrushing_*` | 25 recipes were present, now 0 (Fixes 4) | pass after fix |
| Mekanism metal ingots hidden | Mek tin/bronze/steel/lead/uranium ingots lose to TFC/IE | Almost Unified now hides `mekanism:ingot_tin`, `ingot_bronze`, `ingot_steel`, `ingot_lead`, `ingot_uranium` (and `nugget_lead`, `nugget_steel`, `nugget_uranium`); osmium stays Mekanism by design. Before the fix AU hid the TFC ingots instead | pass after fix (EMI view needs client, C14/C19) |
| Create crushing of ores | no `create:crushing/raw_*`, `*_ore`, compat ores, the four Create stones | none left; 44 `firmages:crushing/*` present | pass |
| TFC knapping / heating from KubeJS | exist | `firmages:knapping/unfired_hearth_idol` (tfc:knapping), `firmages:heating/hearth_idol` and 8 more (tfc:heating) | pass |
| TFC results stay TFC | casting/anvil/welding/quern give TFC items | before the fix: `tfc:casting/copper_ingot` → `minecraft:copper_ingot`, `tfc:casting/tin_ingot` → `mekanism:ingot_tin`, `tfc:anvil/metal/ingot/black_steel` → `immersiveengineering:ingot_steel`, TFC quern powders → 100 mB Mekanism dusts (×5 per ore). After: all TFC; the only non-TFC results are the Mekanism osmium ingot, Mekanism sulfur dust and `mekanism:steel_casing`, which the design wants | pass after fix (Fixes 5) |

### Worldgen (fresh world, Chunky, `scan_regions.py`)

| Check | Command | Expected | Observed | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pregen overworld | `chunky spawn`, `chunky radius 512`, `chunky start` | completes | 4,225 chunks in 64 s; 3,219 full chunks inside the circle scanned | pass |
| Create zinc and striated ores | `scan_regions.py --x -2912 --z -2236 --radius 512` | 0 | `create:zinc_ore`, `deepslate_zinc_ore`, `crimsite`, `asurine`, `veridium`, `ochrum`: 0 | pass |
| IE ores | same | 0 | `immersiveengineering:*`: 0 blocks | pass |
| Mekanism ores | same | 0 | `mekanism:*`: 0 blocks | pass |
| Occultism silver | same | 0 | `occultism:silver_ore*`: 0 | pass |
| TFC ores present | same | > 0 | 1,690,551 `tfc:ore/*` blocks in 98 ids | pass |
| Draconic, Mystical Agriculture (Doc 08 §13.2 rule 2) | Nether and overworld scans | 0 | first world: 239 `draconicevolution:nether_draconium_ore` and 127,476 `mysticalagriculture:soulstone`/`soulium_ore` in 112 Nether chunks; fresh world after Fixes 6: 0 of both in 204 Nether chunks and in the overworld | pass after fix |
| Other ore sources | same | – | `mekatfc:ore/*_native_osmium/*` 118,990 blocks and `tfc_ie_addon:ore/*` (galena, bauxite, uraninite) 275,530 blocks generate and have **no ore disguise** | open point |
| Ore disguise config | `/fa_dims` (reads LockRegistry) | loads without errors | 996 `[[ores.overrides]]` rows (age_1 488, age_2 255, age_3 168, age_4 85), all targets are registered blocks, spoof active | pass; the visual check needs client (C3) |

### Dimensions

| Check | Command | Expected | Observed | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The Origin | `/fa_dims` | `firmages:origin` exists if defined | not defined yet; `age_9.toml` already locks `id:firmages:origin` | noted (not built) |
| Nether via Beneath | `execute in minecraft:the_nether run locate biome #minecraft:is_nether`; Chunky radius 128 | Beneath terrain | `nether_wastes` found; 204 chunks with 37,202 `beneath:*` blocks (crackrack, nether gold ore, cursecoal), TFC magma rock | pass; the ritual portal needs client |
| Twilight Forest | Chunky radius 128 in `twilightforest:twilight_forest` | dimension generates | 204 chunks, 41 `twilightforest:*` block ids | pass |
| Dimension locks | `/fa_dims` | Twilight age_2, Nether age_3, End age_6, Ad Astra 7/8, all Stargate Journey worlds disabled | as expected after Fixes 7; before, `sgjourney:destiny` and `sgjourney:tollan` had no lock. `ae2:spatial_storage` has none (reachable only through AE2 spatial IO) | pass after fix |
| Teleport-back on a locked dimension | `/execute in twilightforest:twilight_forest run tp @s ...` | sent back | needs a player | needs client (C9) |

### Performance (fresh world, after pregen, no player)

| Measure | Command | Observed |
|---|---|---|
| TPS | `spark tps` | 20.0 (5 s, 10 s, 1 m); the 5 m value (15.3) still contains the pregen |
| MSPT | `spark tps` | min/median/95th/max 1.5 / 1.9 / 2.7 / 3.3 ms |
| All dimensions | `neoforge tps` | 20 TPS in all 25 dimensions; overall 1.6 ms/tick (first world, after pregen) |
| Memory | `spark health` | 4.8 GB of 8.0 GB heap in use (60 %) |
| GC | `spark gc` | G1 young 31.8 ms average every 6 s; no old-generation collection |
| CPU | `spark health` | process 0 to 1 %, system 13 % |
| Profiler | `spark profiler start`, 5 min, `spark profiler stop --save-to-file` | PROFILER_RESULT |

## Fixes made in the repo

1. **Rhino loop-body `const` (A5).** `grants.js` `reconcileNow()` declared `const wanted` inside a `for` loop. Rhino
   reports "redeclaration of var" on the second pass, so **every** reconcile (every Age grant, every login) threw before
   it granted a mob or helper stage. `debug/scan.js` had the same pattern. Both rewritten without a loop-body declaration.
2. **Almost Unified default config (A8, unification).** The pack shipped no AU config, so AU 1.4.2 ran with its defaults
   (`minecraft, kubejs, create, immersiveengineering, mekanism`): every TFC casting, anvil and welding recipe gave vanilla,
   Mekanism, IE or Create metal, and AU hid the TFC ingots and sheets in EMI. New `config/almostunified/unification/materials.json`:
   `mod_priorities` from Doc 10 v3 §8.2; dust and nugget overrides from §8.1 (dusts Mekanism, else IE, zinc `firmages`;
   copper/zinc/brass nuggets Create, iron/gold nuggets vanilla); `c:ores`, `c:raw_materials` and `c:storage_blocks/raw_*` taken out
   of the unified tags, because TFC ore grades and rock variants share those tags and AU collapsed them (small, poor and rich
   ore pieces became interchangeable, TFC collapse recipes turned ores into Mekanism/Create ore blocks); five Ad Astra
   `*_plateblock` recipes that AU could not rebuild are ignored.
3. **Tag hygiene for AU (`tags/unification.js`).** AU turns every tag member into the tag's target. TFC puts rose gold in
   `c:ingots/gold`, sterling silver in `c:ingots/silver`, cast and pig iron in `c:ingots/iron`, the coloured and high-carbon
   steels in `c:ingots/steel`, bismuth and black bronze in `c:ingots/bronze` (same for blocks), and its 5 mB ore powders in
   `c:dusts/<metal>`. These entries are removed; `tfc:metal/rod/wrought_iron` joins `c:rods/iron`.
4. **Zinc gate (`recipes/age_1/bronze_age.js`).** `woodencog:rock_knapping/andesite_alloy` and `..._deploying` made andesite
   alloy from andesite rocks alone. Removed, like the iron-nugget variants (Doc 10 v3 §7.3). TFCreate's welding recipes
   (ore piece + andesite → 4 alloy) stay.
5. **IE hammer (`recipes/global_removals.js`).** The 25 `plate_*_hammering`, `hammercrushing_*`, `raw_hammercrushing_*` grid
   recipes are removed (Doc 10 v3 §7.3, IE row).
6. **Foreign worldgen (Doc 08 §13.2 rule 2; config-todo rows 3 to 5).** `config/mysticalagriculture-common.toml`
   `generate{Prosperity,Inferium}Ore`/`generateSoulstone = false`; `neoforge:none` for the four Mystical Agradditions ore
   modifiers and for Draconic's overworld and Nether draconium. File names and keys taken from the jars and the generated config.
7. **Stargate Journey locks (`stages/disabled.toml`).** Added `sgjourney:destiny` and `sgjourney:tollan`, the two worlds missing
   from the research list.
8. **Tooling.** `dev/rcon.py`, `dev/scan_regions.py`, `dev/poc_analyze.py`, `run_server.py --hold` plus console inbox,
   `debug/dump.js`, `/fa_selftest` in `grants.js`.

## Open points

- **Undisguised non-TFC ores.** MekaTFC osmium (Doc 10 v3 §8.1: visible from age_5) and TFC-IE galena (age_4), bauxite
  (age_5) and uraninite (hidden until age_7) generate, but `gen_stage_locks.py` only derives overrides from the TFC id list.
  Extending it adds 252 exact-id rows (4 ores x 3 grades x 21 rocks, ids from the item tags) on top of 996; weigh that
  against the C3 performance test.
- **Dawn grid leaks.** 4,144 grid recipes of other mods have no lock of their own (list above), for example AFC planks and
  slabs, Firmalife sandwiches, Mystical Agriculture essence recipes, Create Deco and Framed Blocks decoration. Many need a
  locked ingredient (saw, metal, workbench); whether any is reachable in Dawn is unverified. The Dawn client check (C11)
  shows it; the fix would be `mod:` or `name:` selectors in `age_0.toml` like the TFC ones.
- **KubeJS datapack** does not appear in `datapack list`; checklist item A13 should test the effect instead.
- **Occultism miner** outputs (e.g. `create:raw_zinc_block`, locked by `disabled`) are not yet mapped to TFC ore pieces
  (Doc 08: Mineshaft gives rich ores of unlocked metals, Age 3).
- **The Origin** (`firmages:origin`) does not exist yet.
- Everything marked needs client: C1, C3, C8, C9, C14, C17, C19, C20, C21 in `poc-checklist.md`.
